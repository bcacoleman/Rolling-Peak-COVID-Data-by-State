# Rolling-Peak-COVID-Deaths-by-State
Rolling peak COVID-19 Death Data by State

This code uses data from the Johns Hopkins COVID Data Repository, https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19.  It calculates the peak single day deaths & cases by state and the peak 3-, 5- and 9-day average peak death & case rate by state.  It returns a CSV with each of these values and the date on which they occurred.  Rows are listed by state.
